Before you deploy, make sure you have bower.
If you're not sure, install it like this globally:

```
npm install -g bower
```

You're only supposed to do this once.

Afterwards go in static/ and type:

```
bower install --force
```

You're only supposed to this once unless someone has added a new bower component to bower.json.

To add a new component in bower type:

```
bower install <name-of-component> --save
```
